# ReactAR

This repository features a augmented reality application built with [Viro Media](https://viromedia.com/)  [AR API](https://viromedia.com/viroar).
The main goal is to refactor *ViroReact* from a class bound component, to a functional component, in order to use *React Hooks* and newer technologies.

## Motivation
I've been developing native AR iOS applications with Swift, but the learning curve discouraged me. Seen that I have 2 years of experience developing ReactNative applications, ReactViro seemed to be the way to go. I aim to keep developing AR apps with Swift, but for the main time, I'll be updating this repository with the knowledge acquired.

### Pain
unfortunately, ViroReact has been losing attention day by day, since it's now open source community maintence is essential, and the latest commit is 6 months old.
I believe that with increased interest in AR and VR, Viro may thrive.
